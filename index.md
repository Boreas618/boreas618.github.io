My research interests focus on developing next-generation memory systems for data centers to support various workloads (e.g., ML training, model serving, scientific computing, etc.). Additionally, I am interested in explaining artificial intelligence models at different levels (e.g., from transformers to autonomous driving systems).

I am a fan of NBA games, though I'm not very good at playing basketball myself. I really enjoy traveling and exploring cities around the world. Cities I've visited include Shanghai, Melbourne, Tokyo, and more.
