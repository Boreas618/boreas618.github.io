To enter the critical section, the thread needs to acquire the ownership of the locks on its path from the leaf till the root (system level), e.g., core, NUMA node, and system. To exploit locality, the lock is passed to the waiting thread, which shares most levels (e.g., in the same core or in the same NUMA node), as long as the threshold at that level is not reached.</p></blockquote><h3 id="heterogeneous-numa-aware-locks" tabindex="-1">Heterogeneous NUMA-aware Locks <a class="header-anchor" href="#heterogeneous-numa-aware-locks" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Heterogeneous NUMA-aware Locks&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>HMCS lock</strong>: each level contains a set of MCS locks.</p><p><strong>Lock Cohorting</strong>: a technique that allows combining different NUMA-oblivious locks in a 2-level hierarchy.</p><p>Locks created with a hierarchy of different locks are <strong>level-heterogeneous</strong>, whereas locks created with a hierarchy of identical locks are <strong>level-homogeneous</strong>.
